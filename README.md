**# Reward Design Alters Learned Behaviour**



**This experiment studies how reinforcement learning agents change behaviour when only the reward definition changes.**



**Same algorithm**

**Same environment**

**Different objective → different behaviour**



**## Key Observation**

**The agent optimizes the reward specification rather than the intended task.**



**## Result**

**!\[Result](result.png)**



**The number of steps required to reach the goal varies significantly depending on reward design, showing how incentive alignment determines behaviour.**



**This demonstrates a core challenge in responsible AI: correct learning does not imply correct behaviour.**
